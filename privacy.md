# SharpSignal Privacy Notice (AI + Automation)

Last updated: 2026-01-01

## What we collect
SharpSignal may collect:
- Account information (email, authentication identifiers)
- Subscription/payment metadata (via Stripe; we do not store full card details)
- Usage/event metadata (page views, basic product analytics if enabled)
- Operational logs required to run the service (timestamps, status, error codes)

## What we do NOT collect (by default)
- We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (e.g., SSNs, health data).
- We do not need or request device-level permissions beyond what the web app requires.

## AI / model inputs
If SharpSignal includes AI-powered features (e.g., chat, summaries, assistants):
- We minimize the data included in model requests.
- We avoid sending personally identifying information (PII) unless required for the feature.
- We do not use user-provided AI inputs to train models unless explicitly disclosed and opt-in.

## Data sharing & third-party processors
SharpSignal uses third-party services strictly to operate the product. Examples may include:
- **Stripe** (payments/subscriptions)
- **Telegram** (notifications/alerts, if user opts in)
- **The Odds API / data providers** (sports data feeds)
- **Google APIs** (Sheets access for internal logging, if enabled)
- **Cloud infrastructure providers** (hosting, storage, logging)

We only share the minimum necessary data to provide the service.

## Data security
We use reasonable security controls such as:
- Least-privilege access for tokens/credentials
- Secrets stored in environment variables / managed secrets (not in source code)
- TLS/HTTPS for data in transit where applicable

## User choices & deletion requests
You may request deletion of your account data by contacting support. We will delete or anonymize data where feasible, subject to legal/operational requirements.
